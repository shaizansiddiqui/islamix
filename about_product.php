provides a sea of knowledge.With such vast information available at our fingertips, it
can get difficult and confusing to filter out authentic Islamic websites from the rest.
Since a vast majority of Muslims and non-Muslims turn to the World Wide Web to
research and learn more about the various aspects of Islam, making sure people read
things that are in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah rather than getting wrong
information about islam.This website provide correct information to Muslim as well
as non-Muslims, removing various misunderstandings and misconceptions about
Islam.The main motto or objective of ISLMIX website is to provide complete information of the five pillars of Islam i.e,<br><b> Shahadah(Iman), Prayer(Namaz),
Fasting(Roza), Charity(Zakat), Pilgrimage(Hajj).</b>
